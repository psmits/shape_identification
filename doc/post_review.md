changes since rejection
-----------------------

three datasets

- mamorata
- trachemys (two subspecies/species)
- seven clear cut species


changes to analysis

- dropped unsupervised analysis
- increased number of PCs as predictors
  - done as response to reviewers
- include size as predictor of category
  - done as response to reviewers


new results

- everything is the same
- more and more proof method works 
- marmorata still has no great classification method




notes from reviews
------------------

lots of grammatical/typography issues. these appear to be a product of the long
drawn out writing/editing process this manuscript went through. so many things
to fix. this also leads to issues surrounding abbreviations and scheme titles.

trachemys is the key to updating this paper. the comparison is much more
appropriate than the clear cut example.

everyone really wants me to make sure i include something about sexual
dimorphism.

include size as a predictor of category (actually a piece of good advice) 

slow the manuscript down a lot. while it is generally straight forward, it is
a bit slap-dash.
