abstract = {We investigated the phylogeography of wood turtles, Glyptemys insculpta, in North America using 750 bp of the mitochondrial control region from 117 individuals sampled at 29 localities across the species' range. A total of 21 haplotypes were identified and little genetic variation was found. The highest pairwise difference was 2{\%}. From nested clade analysis (NCA), one main postglacial dispersal route was inferred along the east coast, with subsequent westward dispersal. NCA further revealed some patterns of restricted gene flow/dispersal. We propose that wood turtles experienced a combined effect of bottleneck during the Pleistocene as well as of selective sweep, which produced the low level of variation observed. Following the Pleistocene, wood turtles would have undergone a rapid northward expansion from a common southern refugium as glaciers retreated. These findings shed light on where to direct conservation priorities, on conservation strategies needed, and on the potential effects of interpopulation transfers for this vulnerable species.},

abstract = {Studies of population genetics in turtles have suggested that turtles do not experience genetic impacts of bottlenecks as strongly as expected. However, recent studies cast doubt on two commonly used tests implemented in the program BOTTLENECK, suggesting that these findings should be re-evaluated. The Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata (Schneider, 1792)) is endangered both globally and within Canada, but genetic data required to develop effective recovery strategies are unavailable. Here, we conducted the first study of population genetic structure in C. guttata. We then used multiple small populations of C. guttata as replicates to test whether the commonly used program BOTTLENECK could detect the genetic signature of bottlenecks in our study populations, which are all thought to have experienced significant declines in the past 2–3 generations (75 years). Turtles (n = 256) were genotyped at 11 microsatellite loci. A suite of Bayesian population genetics analyses and a principal coordinates analysis identi...},

abstract = {Blanding's turtle (Emys blandingii) has declined substantially in North America due to anthropogenic activities, leaving populations smaller and increasingly fragmented spatially. We sampled 212 turtles to evaluate variation at eight microsatellite loci within and among 18 populations of E. blandingii across its primary range in the midwestern United States (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska). All loci and populations were highly polymorphic. Our analyses also detected considerable genetic structure within and among the sampled localities, and revealed ancestral gene flow of E. blandingii in this region north and east from an ancient refugium in the central Great Plains, concordant with post-glacial recolonization timescales. The data further implied unexpected 'links' between geographically disparate populations in Nebraska and Illinois. Our study encourages conservation decisions to be mindful of the genetic uniqueness of populations of E. blandingii across its primary range. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},
