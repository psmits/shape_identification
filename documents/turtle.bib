abstract = {Morphology reflects ecological pressures, phylogeny, and genetic and biophysical constraints. Disentangling their influence is fundamental to understanding selection and trait evolution. Here, we assess the contributions of function, phylogeny, and habitat to patterns of plastron (ventral shell) shape variation in emydine turtles. We quantify shape variation using geometric morphometrics, and determine the influence of several variables on shape using path analysis. Factors influencing plastron shape variation are similar between emydine turtles and the more inclusive Testudinoidea. We evaluate the fit of various evolutionary models to the shape data to investigate the selective landscape responsible for the observed morphological patterns. The presence of a hinge on the plastron accounts for most morphological variance, but phylogeny and habitat also correlate with shape. The distribution of shape variance across emydine phylogeny is most consistent with an evolutionary model containing two adaptive zones--one for turtles with kinetic plastra, and one for turtles with rigid plastra. Models with more complex adaptive landscapes often fit the data only as well as the null model (purely stochastic evolution). The adaptive landscape of plastron shape in Emydinae may be relatively simple because plastral kinesis imposes overriding mechanical constraints on the evolution of form.},

abstract = {We present a phylogenetic hypothesis and novel, rank-free classification for all extant species of softshell turtles (Testudines:Trionychidae). Our data set included DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial protein-coding genes and a approximately 1-kb nuclear intron for 23 of 26 recognized species, and 59 previously published morphological characters for a complimentary set of 24 species. The combined data set provided complete taxonomic coverage for this globally distributed clade of turtles, with incomplete data for a few taxa. Although our taxonomic sampling is complete, most of the modern taxa are representatives of old and very divergent lineages. Thus, due to biological realities, our sampling consists of one or a few representatives of several ancient lineages across a relatively deep phylogenetic tree. Our analyses of the combined data set converge on a set of well-supported relationships, which is in accord with many aspects of traditional softshell systematics including the monophyly of the Cyclanorbinae and Trionychinae. However, our results conflict with other aspects of current taxonomy and indicate that most of the currently recognized tribes are not monophyletic. We use this strong estimate of the phylogeny of softshell turtles for two purposes: (1) as the basis for a novel rank-free classification, and (2) to retrospectively examine strategies for analyzing highly homoplasious mtDNA data in deep phylogenetic problems where increased taxon sampling is not an option. Weeded and weighted parsimony, and model-based techniques, generally improved the phylogenetic performance of highly homoplasious mtDNA sequences, but no single strategy completely mitigated the problems of associated with these highly homoplasious data. Many deep nodes in the softshell turtle phylogeny were confidently recovered only after the addition of largely nonhomoplasious data from the nuclear intron.},

abstract = {The turtle shell is an evolutionary novelty that is synapomorphic for chelonians. The carapace is initiated by the entrapment of the ribs by the carapacial ridge (CR), a lateral bulge of the dorsal ectoderm and dermal mesoderm. The mechanisms by which the CR is initiated, the ribs entrapped and the dorsal dermis ossified, remains unknown. Similarly, the formation of the plastron remains unexplained. Here, we present a series of anatomical investigations into plastron and carapace formation in the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta, and the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina. We document the entrapment of the ribs by the CR and the formation of the plastron and carapacial bones by intramembranous ossification. We note the formation of the ossification centers around each rib, which suggest that the rib is organizing dermal ossification by secreting paracrine factors. The nuchal ossification center is complex and appears to involve multiple bone-forming regions. Individual ossification centers at the periphery of the carapace form the peripheral and pygial bones. The intramembranous ossification of the plastron proceeds from nine distinct ossification centers, and there appear to be interactions between the spicules of apposing centers as they draw near each other.},

abstract = {Microevolutionary studies often find that complex quantitative characters are highly evolvable and adapted to the local environment, while macroevolutionary studies often show evidence of strong phylogenetic effects and stasis. In this contribution, we show how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to test hypotheses that may help resolve this paradox. As a test case, we studied the interplay between adaptation and phylogenetic inertia on the thermobiology of 32 species of Liolaemus (Squamata: Liolaemidae), a genus of South American lizards living under diverse climatic conditions. Despite a strong phylogenetic effect in the preferred (selected) body temperature, we found clear evidence that this variable is adapted to local temperature and climate. After controlling for adaptation to the thermal environment, little influence of phylogeny was left. This indicates that the phylogenetic effect was not caused by a lag or slowness in adaptation but primarily by the distribution of the thermal environments on the phylogeny. This can be due to thermal niche tracking. In contrast, we found little or no evidence for adaptation to the thermal environment in either cooling or heating rates, critical thermal minimum, or body size.},

abstract = {Populations of species that inhabit a range of environments frequently display divergent morphologies that correlate with differences in ecological parameters. The velocity of water flow (i.e., flow velocity) is a critical feature of aquatic environments that has been shown to influence morphology in a broad range of taxa. The focus of this study was to evaluate the relationship between flow velocity and shell morphology for males and females of the semi-aquatic freshwater turtle Pseudemys concinna. For both sexes, the carapace and plastron show significant morphological differences between habitats characterized by slow-flowing (i.e., lentic) and fast-flowing (i.e., lotic) water. In general, the most prominent pattern for both sexes is that the shells of individuals from lotic habitats are more streamlined (small height-to-length ratio) than the shells of individuals from lentic habitats. Of the two shell components (carapace and plastron), the carapace shows greater divergence between habitats, particularly for males. These results are consistent with adaptations to flow velocity, and suggest that variation in shape may be more constrained in females. I also provide empirical evidence for an adaptive benefit of the observed shape change (i.e., drag reduction) and a brief comment on the relative roles of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity in generating shape differences observed in this species.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which widely disjunct members of a clade came to occupy their current distribution is one of the fundamental challenges of biogeography. Here, we used data from 7 nuclear and 1 mitochondrial gene to examine the phylogenetic and biogeographic history of Emys, a clade of turtles that is broadly disjunct in western and eastern North America and Europe. We found strong disagreement between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees, with mitochondrial DNA supporting the monophyly of the North American taxa (marmorata + blandingii) to the exclusion of the European orbicularis, and nuclear genes supporting the monophyly of (blandingii + orbicularis) to the exclusion of marmorata. We used fossil-calibrated molecular chronograms, in combination with supporting evidence from the fossil record and paleoclimatology, to identify a potential example of ancient hybridization and mitochondrial gene capture 12 million years ago, which explains this discrepancy. Based on the weight of evidence, we argue that the invasion of Eurasia by Emys orbicularis occurred about 16 Ma via a trans-Beringian land bridge. The case of Emys emphasizes how single-gene trees can be strongly affected by population processes, including hybridization, and that the effects of these processes can persist through long periods of evolutionary history. Given the chaotic state of the current taxonomy of these turtles, our work also emphasizes the care that should be used in implementing taxonomic changes based on 1 or a few gene trees and the importance of taking a conservative approach in renaming or splitting higher taxa based on apparent nonmonophyly.},

abstract = {We analysed phylogeography and population genetic variation across the range of the western pond turtle (Emys marmorata) using rapidly evolving mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. Nuclear DNA sequences from two unlinked introns displayed extremely low levels of variation, but phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA recovered four well-supported and geographically coherent clades. These included a large Northern clade composed of populations from Washington south to San Luis Obispo County, California, west of the Coast Ranges; a San Joaquin Valley clade from the southern Great Central Valley; a geographically restricted Santa Barbara clade from a limited region in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties; and a Southern clade that occurs south of the Tehachapi Mountains and west of the Transverse Range south to Baja California, Mexico. An analysis of molecular variance (amova) based on regional hydrographic units revealed that populations from the Sacramento Valley north to Washington were virtually invariant, with no evidence of population substructure among northern river drainage basins. In other areas, E. marmorata contains considerable unrecognized variation, particularly in central and southern California and in northern Baja California, Mexico. Our northern clade is congruent with the distribution of the subspecies Emys marmorata marmorata (Washington-central California). However, no clade is congruent with the distribution of the southern subspecies Emys marmorata pallida from central California-Baja. Thus, recognition of the current subspecies split is not warranted, based on the available genetic evidence. Our amova and phylogenetic results, in conjunction with a growing comparative database for other codistributed aquatic taxa, confirm the occurrence of genetic breaks across the Tehachapi Mountains and Transverse Range bounding the southern end of the Great Central Valley, and point to southern California as a rich source of cryptic genetic variation.},

The western pond turtle (Emys marmorata) is an example of a wide-ranging taxon that spans several well-known California diversity hotspots. Using a dataset comprised of one mitochondrial and five nuclear loci, we elucidate the major biogeographic patterns of the western pond turtle across the California landscape. By employing a combination of phylogenetic and network-based approaches, we recovered a relatively ancient (c. 2-8 Ma) north/south split among populations of E. marmorata and find an area of intergradation centred in the Central Coast Ranges of California. In addition, discordant mitochondrial/nuclear genetic patterns suggest subsequent gene flow from northern populations and from San Joaquin Valley populations into the Central Coast Ranges after the Pliocene-Pleistocene marine embayment of the Great Central Valley subsided. Our results emphasize the utility of nuclear DNA phylogeography for recovering the impact of relatively ancient biogeographic events, and suggest that the Central Coast Ranges of California have played a major role in the geographic structuring of the western pond turtle, and possibly other co-distributed taxa.},

These concepts and methods are applied to a dataset of digitized coordinates on 1554 lizard skulls and 1292 lower jaws to test hypotheses of convergence among herbivorous lizards. Encompassing seven independent acquisitions of herbivory, this lizard sample provides an ideal natural experiment for exploring ideas of convergence among different systems (here, morphological and functional). Three related questions are addressed: (1) Do herbivorous lizards show evidence of convergence in skull and lower jaw morphology? (2) What, if any, is the morphospace pattern associated with this convergence? (3) Is it possible to predict the direction of convergence using functional models? Relative warp analysis and permutation tests reveal that the skulls and lower jaws of herbivorous lizards do show evidence of convergence. Herbivore skulls deviate from their carnivorous or omnivorous sister groups toward the same area of morphospace. Without a phylogenetic perspective, this pattern would not be recognizable. Lower jaws of herbivores are not convergent in morphology but are convergent in function: herbivores deviate away from their carnivorous sister groups toward higher values of mechanical advantage. These results illustrate the desirability of quantitative methods, informed by phylogenetic information, in the study of convergence.},

abstract = {Finite element (FE) models are popular tools that allow biologists to analyze the biomechanical behavior of complex anatomical structures. However, the expense and time required to create models from specimens has prevented comparative studies from involving large numbers of species. A new method is presented for transforming existing FE models using geometric morphometric methods. Homologous landmark coordinates are digitized on the FE model and on a target specimen into which the FE model is being transformed. These coordinates are used to create a thin-plate spline function and coefficients, which are then applied to every node in the FE model. This function smoothly interpolates the location of points between landmarks, transforming the geometry of the original model to match the target. This new FE model is then used as input in FE analyses. This procedure is demonstrated with turtle shells: a Glyptemys muhlenbergii model is transformed into Clemmys guttata and Actinemys marmorata models. Models are loaded and the resulting stresses are compared. The validity of the models is tested by crushing actual turtle shells in a materials testing machine and comparing those results to predictions from FE models. General guidelines, cautions, and possibilities for this procedure are also presented.},

@article{Thomson2010,
abstract = {As phylogenetic data sets grow in size and number, objective methods to summarize this information are becoming increasingly important. Supermatrices can combine existing data directly and in principle provide effective syntheses of phylogenetic information that may reveal new relationships. However, several serious difficulties exist in the construction of large supermatrices that must be overcome before these approaches will enjoy broad utility. We present analyses that examine the performance of sparse supermatrices constructed from large sequence databases for the reconstruction of species-level phylogenies. We develop a largely automated informatics pipeline that allows for the construction of sparse supermatrices from GenBank data. In doing so, we develop strategies for alleviating some of the outstanding impediments to accurate phylogenetic inference using these approaches. These include taxonomic standardization, automated alignment, and the identification of rogue taxa. We use turtles as an exemplar clade and present a well-supported species-level phylogeny for two-thirds of all turtle species based on a approximately 50 kb supermatrix consisting of 93\% missing data. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining pitfalls and concerns associated with supermatrix analyses, provide comparisons to supertree approaches, and suggest areas for future research.},
